PyMooshak

Thank you in your interest in using PyMooshak! I'll try to explain what this
software does, and how it can assist you in dodging resource-hungry webrowsers,
and submiting your problems to a mooshak platform.

= DEPENDENCIES =

First of all ensure that you have pyCurl installed on your machine. Most Linux
distros have pyCurl in their repos. In Arch Linux you can get this library by
issuing (as root)

    pacman -S python-pycurl

PyMooshak also depends on the BeautifulSoup library, and it comes bundled.

= USAGE =

First of all, you'll need a mooshak.json file to be inside your coding directory.
This file will contain all the data that the Mooshak server needs to know.
It will contain the mooshak url, your credentials (user name and password),
the contest you are participating and the problem you are trying to solve.

It has this format:

{
    "baseurl": "http://example.com/~mooshak/",
    "contest": "sample1",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "amazinglybigpassword",
    "problem": "prob1"
}

I think this JSON file can talk by itself (and you don't need to know JSON =P).
Now, the contest and problem IDs can be retrieved with:

    pymooshak contests              # Lists running contests
    pymooshak problems <contest>    # Lists problems in a running contest

For these commands to run correctly, you need at least to have the baseurl
specified in the mooshak.json file.

If you run the `pymooshak contests` command, you may get an output similiar to
this:

    sample1: Sample Contest 1
    sample2: Sample Contest 2

In the first line, "sample1" is a contest ID, and "Sample Contest 1" is the
contest name that you see when using the Mooshak web interface.

The `pymooshak problems` command is similar to the `pymooshak contests`. The
only difference is that you must pass a contest ID. Imagine that you've run
`pymooshak problems sample1`, and you got this output:

    prob1: A
    prob2: B

What comes before ':' is the problem ID, what comes after ':' is the name that
you see in the Mooshak web interface.

If you have any doubts about using this, or if you have a better usage method,
please e-mail me. This is best CLI that I could come up with... =(
